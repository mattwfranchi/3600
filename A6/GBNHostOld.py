# In this class you will implement a full-duplex Go-Back-N client. Full-duplex means that this client can 
# both send and receive data. You are responsible for implementing a Go-Back-N protocol in a simulated
# Transport layer. We are not going to use real network calls in this project, as we want to precisely 
# simulate when packet delay, loss, and corruption occurs. As such, your simulated transport protocol
# will interface with the Simulator object to communicate with simulated Application and Network layers.
#

# The Simulator will call three functions that you are responsible for implementing. These functions define
# the interface by which the simulated Application and Network layers communicate with your transport layer:
# - receive_from_application_layer(payload) will be called when the Simulator has new data from the application
#   layer that needs to be sent across the network
# - receive_from_network_layer(byte_data) will be called when the Simulator has received a new packet from the
#   network layer that the transport layer needs to process
# - timer_interrupt() will be called when the Simulator detects that a timer has expired 


# Your code can communicate with the Simulator by calling four methods:
# - Call self.simulator.pass_to_application_layer(data) when your Transport layer has successfully received and processed
#   a data packet from the other host that needs to be delivered up to the Application layer
#    * pass_to_application_layer(data) expects to receive the payload of a packet as a decoded string, not as the bytes object 
#      generated by unpack
# - Call self.simulator.pass_to_network_layer(byte_data) when your Transport layer has created a data packet or an ACK packet
#   that needs to be sent across the network to the other host
#    * pass_to_network_layer() expects to receive a packet that has been converted into a bytes object using pack. See the
#      next section in this comment for more detail
# - Call self.simulator.start_timer(self.entity, self.timer_interval) when you want to start a timer
# - Call self.simulator.stop_timer(self.entity) when you want to stop the running timer


# You will need to write code to pack/unpack data into a byte representation appropriate for 
# communication across a network. For this assignment, you will assume that all packets use the following header:
# - Sequence Number (int)           -- Set to 0 if this is an ACK
# - Acknowledgement Number (int)    -- Set to 0 if this is not an ACK
# - Checksum (half)                 -- Compute a UDP Checksum, as discussed in class
# - Acknowledgement Flag (boolean)  -- Set to True if sending an ACK, otherwise False
# - *Payload* length, in bytes (int)  -- Set this to 0 when sending an ACK message, as these will not carry a payload
# - Payload (string)                -- Leave this empty when sending an ACK message
# When unpacking data in this format, it is recommended to first unpack the fixed length header. After unpacking the
# header, you can determine if there is a payload, based on the size of Payload Length.
# NOTE: It is possible for payload length to be corrupted. In this case, you will get an Exception similar to
#       "unpack requires a buffer of ##### bytes". If you receive this exception, this is a sign that the packet is
#       corrupt. This is not the only way the packet can be corrupted, but is a special case of corruption that will
#       prevent you from unpacking the payload. If you can unpack the payload, use the checksum to determine if the
#       packet is corrupted. If you CAN'T unpack the payload, then you already KNOW that the packet is corrupted.


# Finally, you will need to implement the UDP Checksum algorithm to check for corruption in your packets. 
# As discussed in class, sum each of the 16-bit words of the packet, carrying around any overflow bits. Once you 
# have summed all of the 16-bit words, perform the 1's complement. If a packet contains an odd number of bytes 
# (i.e. the last byte doesn't fit into a 16-bit word), pad the packet (when computing the checksum) with a 0 byte. 
# When receiving a packet, check that it is valid using this checksum.


# NOTE: By default, all of the test cases created for this program capture print() output and save it in a log
#       file with the same name as the test case being run. This will prevent you from printing to the terminal
#       while your code is running (your print statements will be added to the log file instead)
#       You can disable this functionality by editing the test*.cfg file you are working on and removing the  
#       --capture_log argument (just delete it). Do NOT change any other of the option parameters in test*.cfg
